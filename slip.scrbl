Hello!

Welcome to a project I am currently working on, SLIP, which stands for Street Level Image Processing.

This project focuses on developing a  system for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering
through Image Processing Techniques, that I became interested in through the game @hyperlink["https://geoguessr.com"]{GeoGuessr}
The purpose is to identify geographic locations by analyzing distinctive infrastructure features
that vary between regions and countries.
The system employs advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract and analyze geographical infrastructure:
