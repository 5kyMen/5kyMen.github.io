Hello! My name is Ryan Raschkovsky, and welcome to my website!

I'm an undergraduate at Northeastern University in Boston, where I am currently studying for a BA in Cybersecurity.

My interests include:

  @item{Amateur Radio}
  @item{Learning Languages}
  @item{OSINT}
]

I'm currently certified as an FCC Technician for Amateur Radio and am studying multiple languages including Portuguese, Japanese, Mandarin, and TokiPona.

When I'm not working on cybersecurity projects, you can find me building drones, teaching Portuguese, or exploring 3D modeling and design.
